# github-demo
Simple Git Demo Repository to show basic workflow of git

## Why?
I've only used git/GitHub for simply storing the source codes to my fav projects.
Never really understood it fully nor did I knew how to properly utilise it,
until one day when a piece of code I was testing did in fact work but I had to modify and ruin it.
My system restarted and I lost the code forever, had to rewrite.

Understood that this was the pain I needed to learn Git, so I did it!

## When?
So I took up [this course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-complete/), which I do recommend for those starting, and finished this on 24th September 2024.

## Credentials
Here is my certificate to prove that I, infact, did complete the course:
